# Adobe Cep React Starter

> **React , Nodejs , Extendscript & Webpack .**

This is a `starter kit` for developing CEP Panels.

This Template does a bunch of things to make your life easier:

- Compile our Typescript code into a single `.js` file.

- Converts `Extendscript` to `jsxbin` .

- Create the necessary xml files

- Create a `symlink` into the extensions folder so you can test out the extension quickly

- Syncs your `node_modules` (**not** the `dev dependencies`) into the bundle

## Step By Step Guide

- Make Sure You Have The Following things downloaded

  ```
   - node.js

   - npm
  ```

- Run The Following Commands :

  ```
  âš  Note:

  Dont't Put This Project in the Adobe Extension Folder

  You Can Put This Project in your "desktop" or "documents" folder

  The Remaining Work Will Be taken Care by the build scripts.
  ```

  ```
  npm install

  cd server

  npm install
  ```

* You Can Configure the extension settings in the `pluginrc.js` File

  > ðŸ’¡ Tip : You can can change all the words from `starter` to your `extension_name`
